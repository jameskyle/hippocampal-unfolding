This directoy contains several calibrations of the sanyo projection 
LCD display.  

The subdirectory spring95 contains data from a calibration done in Jordan 
Hall not long after the display was purchased.  

The subdirectories 082695 and 082895 are two calibrations done at the
Lucas center.  The chief difference between the spring 95 and the 08*95
calibrations is the shape of the spectral curve for the green gun.  It has
a single peak in the newer calibrations and a double peak in the older one.
In addition there is an overall scaling due to the glass at the lucas center
that was not included in the Jordan Hall calibration.

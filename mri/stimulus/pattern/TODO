1. Make a stimulus with	low spatial frequency S cone variation
interleaved with high frequency LM cone variation.
Do the S cone variation with the blue phosphor.
Look again for spatial patterning of the V1 response.
The S cone signal should be spatially sparse!  There are not
very may S cones or bi-stratified ganglion cells.
Perhaps they are spatially sparse in V1, too.

2. David Spiegel: hypnotize an oclusion.  Maybe Zimbo would do it.

3.  Put red/green glasses on the subject.  Then, make a stimulus
consisting of pure red phosphor rings interleaved with green phosphor
rings.  Check the ocular segregation for the LCD display.

4.  Baizer et al. say that temporal lobe represents the fovea
and that parietal represents the periphery.  See if we can
put two different base frequencies in the fovea and periphery
and detect a temporal difference in areas within parietal and
temporal.


*. Temporal high-frequency versus temporal low-frequency rings?
*.  Orientation?

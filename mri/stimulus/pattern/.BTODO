1. Make a stimulus with
	low-frequency S cone variation
	high frequency LM cone variation

Move these rings out eccentrically and rotate them around.

2. David Spiegel: hypnotize an oclusion.  Maybe Zimbo would do it.

3. Temporal high-frequency versus temporal low-frequency rings?

4.  Orientation?

5.  Put red/green glasses on the subject.  
Then, make a stimulus consisting of
pure red phosphor rings interleaved with green phosphor rings.

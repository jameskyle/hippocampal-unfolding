* Flat/mrCreateFlatAnat.m: added unfoldSubDir as an input parameter to the
	function so that one of several unfolds of the same gray matter can
	be specified.  Also added a comment and unfdir to be saved out in
	FCorAnal_HEMISPHERE so that it contains the directory of the
	flattened file that was used to create it.

* Flat/mrProjectCorAnal.m: added user query for unfold subdirectory in cases
	when FCorAnal_HEMISPHERE does not exist and needs to be created.

* mrFullAnalysis.m: added unfoldSubDir as an input parameter to
	'mrCreateFlatAnat.m' so that one of several unfolds of the same gray
	matter can be specified.  Also added a comment and unfdir to be
	saved out in FCorAnal_HEMISPHERE so that it contains the directory
	of the flattened file that was used to create it.

* Flat/mrProjectCorAnal.m: started to updated from VolParams to AlignParams

* Special/mrMakeInplaneMap.m: updated from volparams to alignparams

*	We looked into Special/mrTiffImage.m because of the bug 
	with little black spots occuring sometimes.  We fixed
	getMrGetLoadRetImage which had a bug in color map creation.

* 	We changed the printouts in mrBlurExp.m.  There appears to be a bug
	in the calculation concerning a divide by zero.  This should be
	checked.  It is serious for the complex value calculations, but we
	couldn't figure it out just now.  Do figure it out.

* 	We change the positions of the sliders and buttons so they
	would be visible in 5.2.

Thu Apr 23 14:09:39 1998  Suelika Chial  <schial@orange.Stanford.EDU>

*	Added 'calculate 3D correlations' and 'create OFF files' as
	steps 10 and 11 in 'mrFullAnalysis.m'.  'calculate 3D correlations' maps
	all the activity onto 3D (x,y,z) locations and compresses data on
	all layers of gray matter onto the first layer.  'create OFF files'
	is only being used temporarily until a better function is written
	and incorporated into mrGray.

*	Added 3D menu in 'mrLoadRet.m' to save out amp, co, ph, or dc data in
	x,y,z, R,G,B format for rendering purposes

*	All of the code used for the new tools is contained in the '3D' subdirectory.
	'initPath.m' now includes that subdirectory as part of the path.

	relating to Unfold but needing to be logged somewhere... Tony Morland suggested here.
	replaced keepNodes.m and removeNodes.m in .../stanford/mri/utility with updated
	versions from the UK to try to get Unfold going smoothly on the Sun.
	Old versions renamed temporarily to keepNodesWAS.m and removeNodesWAS.m

Fri Jan 30 10:41:51 1998  Allen Poirson  (poirson@ecru.Stanford.EDU)

	* change to 'isempty()' construct on lines 23,31 and 54
	of 'checkForShift'.
	
	* Included the 'checkForShift' option into the 5.0 version.
	Somehow this was left out.  This entry goes under the pull
	down menu 'Special'.

* makeTiffColorBar.m: Added this routine for taking the Map file from 
	Special->ImageManagement->TiffSave 
  and creating a small tiff file with the color bar for making images.
  This routine is not fully debugged at this point...I will add another
  entry when I get to debug it some more.  Also, I don't really think
  the routine should go in mrLoadRet, except that it is built to work
  with mrLoadRet output files and I don't know where else to put it -- BW

* Flat/flatTseries.m: The version of flatTseries.m in this directory 
      did NOT contain the bug fix that Geoff had made.  Although the
      HISTORY comment claimed that gmb had made the change on 12/12/96,
      the change was actually implemented around 07/15/97.  The wrong 
      version found its way into both mrLoadRet-0.0 and mrLoadRet-1.0.
      I changed them both to the correct version (from mrLoadRet in
      matlab-4.2c

%
%  01/22/98  hab  Updated for matlab5 (changed ~=[] to ~isempty)
%  Added some comments. 
%  Copied the right version to mrLoadRet-0.0 and mrLoadRet-1.0
%
% HISTORY:
%  12/12/96  gmb  Fixed bug regarding looping through inplanes
%
%  NOTE:  Actually, I believe that this bug was fixed around 07/15/97
%  by gmb.  The old code is saved in the file BADflatTseries.m.
%  The problem was that it was loading each tSeries file in an
%  outer loop, then looping through each inplane in an inner loop
%  (even though each tSeries file is specific for a single
%  inplane).  The results was that it effectively averaged the
%  value at each pixel across all inplanes.  The bad version
%  crept into mrLoadRet-0.0 (Li Lea's matlab5 update) and 
%  then mrLoadRet-1.0.- hab

	* (ROIPlot/plotMeanTSeries): line 56 contained misspelling 
	of 'viewplane'. Changed incorrect 'viewPlane' to 'viewplane'.

	* (ROIPlot/plotMeanTSeries): same line as above passed argument
	'curSer' instead of correct 'curExp'.  Fixed

	

	
Mon Jan 19 11:06:46 1998  Brian Wandell  <brian@khaki.Stanford.EDU>

*  (ROIPlot/plotMeanTSeries): Did not load the flattened tSeries correctly.
	replaced the load tSeries call with mrLoadTSeries to get either
	viewPlane data in properly.

	Also, the routine did not calculate nTicks right when setting
	the grid on the graph, not accounting for junkimages.

Thu Jan  8 14:16:16 1998  David Heeger  <heeger@teal.Stanford.EDU>

* Analysis/mrFTCorSeries.m: fixed the phase calculation.



Thurs March 12th, 14:20 1998  Rehan Khan <khan@psych.stanford.edu>

modified mrLoadRet.m

Added 'ROI as dist' option to 'ROI Plots' menu.  This uses mrROIdist.m and for a given ROI, allows the user to specify an origin in the image and plots the ROI as a function of euclidian distance in the image from the origin.  Plots either the phase, amplitude or correlation values for the ROI.  The origin is specified with a mouse click.  

mrROIdist.m was added to the ROIPlots directory.
